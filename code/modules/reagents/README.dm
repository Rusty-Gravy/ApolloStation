CHEMISTRY AND MATERIALS REWRITE - 2015 - Kwask

	Attempts to expand the gameplay mechanics of chemistry making
	materials and chemicals a much larger part of the game overall.

	IMPORTANT BITS
		- "Reagents" have been renamed to "Chemicals", because not all chemicals have to be reagents
		- Most items, machines, and structures are composed of chemicals
		- Heat plays an important role in reactions
		- Chemicals have certain rareties, rather than chemistry having a near-inifite amount of every element
		- Molten metals can be alloyed together, combining their properties
